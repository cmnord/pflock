//! This library provides a phase-fair reader-writer lock, as described in the
//! paper ["Reader-Writer Synchronization for Shared-Memory Multiprocessor
//! Real-Time Systems"](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/papers/ecrts09b.pdf)
//! by Brandenburg et. al.
//!
//! > Reader preference, writer preference, and task-fair reader-writer locks are
//! > shown to cause undue blocking in multiprocessor real-time systems. A new
//! > phase-fair reader-writer lock is proposed as an alternative that
//! > significantly reduces worst-case blocking for readers.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use pflock::PFLock;
//!
//! let lock = PFLock::new(5);
//!
//! // many reader locks can be held at once
//! {
//!     let r1 = lock.read();
//!     let r2 = lock.read();
//!     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
//!     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
//! } // read locks are dropped at this point
//!
//! // only one write lock may be held, however
//! {
//!     let mut w = lock.write();
//!     *w += 1;
//!     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
//! } // write lock is dropped here
//! ```
//!
//! # Spin vs. suspend
//!
//! `PFLock` is a spinlock specifically targeted at **short critical sections** and
//! does not suspend threads while blocking. Section 3 of the paper addresses this:
//!
//! > The terms “short” and “long” arise because (intuitively) spinning is
//! > appropriate only for short critical sections, since spinning wastes processor
//! > time. However, two recent studies have shown that, in terms of
//! > schedulability, spinning is usually preferable to suspending when overheads
//! > are considered [11, 15]. Based on these trends (and due to space
//! > constraints), we restrict our focus to short resources in this paper and
//! > delegate RW synchronization of long resources to future work.
